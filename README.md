# Natural Language Processing and Language Modeling Projects

Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Language Modeling (LLM) projects repository! This repository hosts various projects related to NLP and LLM implemented using PyTorch. Each project is encapsulated within its own directory and includes relevant Jupyter Notebooks, code, and datasets.

## Projects:

### Project 1: Bigram Analysis and Training Language Model
- Bigram Analysis
    - Explore the relationships between consecutive characters in a given text using a bigram model.
    - Visualize bigram counts using a matrix representation.
- Language Model Training
    - Train character-level language models using PyTorch.
    - Implement training functions that utilize gradient descent and L2 regularization to update model weights.
- Word Generation
    - Develop functions to generate new words using trained language models.
    - Utilize sampling approaches to predict and simulate the generation of novel words.
